	"summary": "Interchange fees are set by the card networks and are non-negotiable, but there are some ways you can\nlower them or avoid paying them altogether. Here are some tips based on the search results\n\n- **Apply a surcharge** to your customers who pay with credit cards. This way, you can pass on the\ninterchange fee to them and avoid paying it yourself. However, you need to comply with the rules and\nregulations of surcharging, which may vary by state and card network.\n- **Capture more customer data** when processing card transactions, especially for e-commerce and\nphone-based transactions. Providing the cardholder&#39;s full billing address, CVV code, invoice number, and\nother information can help you qualify for lower interchange rates and reduce the risk of fraud and\nchargebacks.\n- **Use updated hardware** that accepts chip cards and contactless payments. Chip cards are more\nsecure than magnetic stripe cards and have lower interchange rates for card-present transactions.\nContactless payments, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, also have lower interchange rates than regular\ncredit cards.\n- **Settle your batch every day**. This means sending your transactions to your processor for\nsettlement at the end of each business day. Doing this can help you avoid higher interchange rates for\ndelayed settlement and reduce the risk of errors and disputes.\n- **Provide more data for B2B transactions**. If you sell to other businesses or government entities, you\nmay qualify for lower interchange rates by providing more data about the transaction, such as tax\namount, customer code, merchant name, and product description. This is called Level 2 or Level 3\nprocessing and requires specialized software or hardware.\n- **Contact your issuing bank** and ask for a reduction. This may not always work, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to\ntry. Sometimes, your bank may be willing to lower your interchange fees if you have a good relationship\nwith them, a high volume of transactions, or a low risk profile.\n- **Use a different payment method** that doesn&#39;t involve an intermediary such as a merchant bank.\nFor example, you can use direct debit, ACH transfer, e-check, or cryptocurrency to accept payments\nfrom your customers. These methods may have lower fees than credit cards or no fees at all. However,\nthey may also have less convenience, security, or customer appeal than credit cards.\n"
